# AI Basketball Stats - Product Requirements Document

## Product Vision

Build an AI-powered video processing system that automatically extracts basketball statistics from game recordings, allowing parents to enjoy watching their kid play instead of manually tracking stats.

---

## Core User Story

**As a parent watching Sahil play basketball:**
- I want to just record the game and enjoy watching
- So that I don't miss moments trying to track stats manually
- And I still get detailed statistics after the game

---

## Key Product Decisions

### Player Context
- **Primary player:** Sahil (only basketball player in family)
- **Teams:** Plays for two different teams
  - Elements (wears #3)
  - Team Unequld (wears #11)
- **Jersey numbers vary by team** â†’ Need flexible setup per game

### Older Brother's Contribution
- Suggested calendar integration idea
- Not a player - just helping with product ideas

---

## Processing Requirements

### Q1: Sample Videos
- **Available:** Multiple YouTube videos of Sahil's games
- **To be provided:** 2-3 sample videos for testing
- **Need for each video:**
  - Team name (Elements or Team Unequld)
  - Jersey number (#3 or #11)
  - Both teams' jersey colors
  - Any quirks (lighting, camera angle, etc.)

### Q2: Jersey Number Recognition
- **Elements:** #3
- **Team Unequld:** #11
- **AI must:** Identify jersey number via OCR to track correct player

### Q3: Team Identification
- **Method:** Jersey colors (visual detection)
- **Workflow:** Pre-game "onboarding" setup
  - Before game: Configure team colors, jersey number, opponent
  - At gym: Just tap "Start" and record
  - No configuration needed during game

### Q4: Processing Time
- **Timeline:** Asynchronous - can process whenever
- **Not required:** Real-time processing
- **Options:**
  - Process on device (iPhone 16 Pro Max)
  - Process on Synology NAS at home
  - Can process overnight
- **No rush:** Stats don't need to be immediate

### Q5: Output Priority
- **Equal importance:**
  1. Accurate Sahil on/off court tracking
  2. Accurate team scores (both teams)
- **Flexible:** Open to adjusting priorities based on what works

---

## Pre-Game Scheduling Workflow (Older Brother's Idea)

### Concept
Instead of configuring at the gym, set up game details in advance:

```
Before Game (at home):
â”œâ”€ Schedule game in app
â”œâ”€ Link to family calendar (optional)
â”œâ”€ Set team info (Elements vs Lakers)
â”œâ”€ Set jersey colors (Blue vs Red)
â”œâ”€ Set player number (#3)
â””â”€ Pre-configured and ready!

At Gym:
â”œâ”€ Open app â†’ See scheduled game
â”œâ”€ Tap "Start Recording"
â”œâ”€ Just record - everything already set
â””â”€ Enjoy watching Sahil play! ðŸŽ‰

After Game (at home):
â”œâ”€ Upload to Synology or process on phone
â”œâ”€ AI analyzes with pre-configured context
â”œâ”€ Review stats (5-10 min)
â””â”€ Save to game history
```

### Benefits
1. **Family coordination** - Everyone knows when games are
2. **No gym scrambling** - Everything pre-configured
3. **Better AI accuracy** - Knows what to look for ahead of time
4. **Calendar integration** - Syncs with family schedule
5. **Reminders** - "Game in 1 hour - charge your phone!"

## What AI Should Extract

### Primary Stats (When Sahil is ON Court)

**Tier 1: High Priority**
- Field Goal Attempts (FGA)
- Field Goals Made (FGM)
- Field Goal Percentage (FG%)
- 2-point vs 3-point breakdown
- Minutes played
- Plus/Minus (team score differential when playing)

**Tier 2: Medium Priority**
- Rebounds (offensive/defensive)
- Free Throws (attempts/made)
- Assists (if detectable)

**Tier 3: Nice to Have**
- Steals
- Blocks
- Turnovers

### Team Stats (Entire Game)
- Both teams' running score
- Final score
- Quarter/half scores
- Game timeline (when Sahil in/out)

---

## Technical Context

### Hardware Available
- **iPhone 16 Pro Max** - Primary recording device, can also process
- **iPad Mini A17** - Secondary device for review/processing
- **Osmo Mobile 7P** - DJI gimbal with ActiveTrack
- **Synology NAS** - Home server for heavy processing

### Existing App (SahilStats)
- **Keep everything:** Current game history, manual entry, analytics
- **Add AI as option:** New way to create games, not replacement
- **Backward compatible:** AI-processed games use same data model

### Data to Preserve
- All historical games and stats
- Career statistics
- Shot charts and analytics
- YouTube upload integration
- Firebase sync

## AI Processing Pipeline

### Input
- Video file (40 min typical game)
- Pre-configured context from scheduled game:
  - Player jersey number (#3 or #11)
  - Team jersey color
  - Opponent jersey color
  - Team names

### Processing Steps
1. **Court Detection** - Find basketball court boundaries
2. **Player Detection** - Identify all players in each frame
3. **Sahil Identification** - Find player with correct jersey # + color
4. **On/Off Tracking** - Determine when Sahil is actively playing
5. **Shot Detection** - Detect when any player shoots
6. **Team Attribution** - Determine which team scored based on jersey color
7. **Score Tracking** - Maintain running score for both teams
8. **Timeline Building** - Create game timeline with key events

### Output
- Game object (same as manual entry)
- Additional AI metadata:
  - Video URL
  - Confidence scores
  - Shot timestamps
  - On/off court timeline
  - Processing date

## Success Metrics for PoC

**We'll know the PoC succeeded if:**

1. âœ… **Sahil Identification:** Correctly identify Sahil in 80%+ of frames where visible
2. âœ… **On/Off Tracking:** Accurately detect 90%+ of Sahil's substitutions
3. âœ… **Shot Detection:** Catch 70%+ of Sahil's shots
4. âœ… **Made/Miss Classification:** 75%+ accuracy on made vs missed
5. âœ… **Score Tracking:** Final score within Â±5 points of actual
6. âœ… **End-to-End Flow:** Complete one full game from scheduling â†’ recording â†’ processing â†’ stats

**If we hit these targets**, we know the approach works and can refine!

## Development Approach

### Recommendation: Integrated Development
- Build AI features into existing SahilStats app
- Create new feature branch: `feature/ai-video-processing`
- Keep all existing features working
- AI becomes additional workflow alongside manual entry

### Why Not Separate PoC?
- Can reuse existing data models (Game, Team, etc.)
- Can reuse Firebase integration
- Can reuse UI components (game list, stats display)
- Faster iteration - see AI games alongside manual games immediately
- No data migration needed later

## Open Questions - ANSWERED

1. **Video Storage:** âœ… ANSWERED
   - **Workflow:** Record on device with gimbal â†’ Store in iCloud during processing
   - **After processing:** Keep video for overlay features, then upload to YouTube
   - **Access:** YouTube ensures access from anywhere
   - **Existing feature:** Leverage current YouTube upload integration

2. **Processing Location:** âœ… ANSWERED
   - **Open to either approach:**
     - iPhone on-device (A18 Pro Neural Engine)
     - Synology NAS (heavy lifting overnight)
   - **Decision:** Start with iPhone, add Synology as fallback/enhancement

3. **Calendar Integration:** âœ… ANSWERED
   - **Primary:** iOS Calendar (EventKit)
   - **Shared family calendar** - so everyone knows game schedule

4. **Multiple Players Future:**
   - **Current:** Only Sahil plays basketball
   - **Design:** Build for single player, easy to extend later if needed

5. **Video Quality:** âœ… ANSWERED
   - **Standard:** 1080p (good balance)
   - **Variable:** Depends on quality needs for specific game
   - **Processing:** 1080p is ideal for AI (4K overkill, 720p may miss details)

- âœ… Stats are 80%+ accurate (within margin of manual tracking)
- âœ… Processing completes in reasonable time (can happen overnight)
- âœ… Workflow is simpler than manual stat tracking
- âœ… Integrates seamlessly with existing app features

**Bonus success:**
- ðŸŽ‰ Other parents ask "how did you build that?"
- ðŸŽ‰ Older brother's friends want it for their siblings
- ðŸŽ‰ Could potentially productize/sell to other families
