## Current Team Management Analysis

### Team Data Structure
**Location**: `Models/Game.swift:591-632`

**Current Team Model**:
- `id: String?` - Firebase document ID (auto-generated)
- `name: String` - Team name
- `createdAt: Date` - Creation timestamp

**Storage**:
- Firebase Firestore collection: `"teams"`
- Real-time sync via snapshot listener
- ~4 games/weekend = ~8 unique teams
- Storage: 8 teams × 50KB/logo = 400KB (negligible vs 5GB limit)
- Bandwidth: Loading logos 20x/day = 1MB/day (way under 1GB/day limit)

**Key Files**:
- Team model: `Models/Game.swift`
- Team management UI: `Views/TeamSettingsView.swift`
- Firebase integration: `Services/FirebaseService.swift`
- Game setup: `Views/GameSetupView.swift`
- Score overlay: `Views/SimpleScoreOverlay.swift`, `Models/SimpleScoreOverlayData.swift`

**Current Strengths**:
- Simple, lightweight team model
- Real-time sync across devices
- Firebase-native persistence
- Easy to add/remove teams
- Team names directly visible in all game contexts

**Current Limitations**:
- Team data only contains name and creation date
- No team colors, logos, or branding
- No team statistics aggregation
- Team selection uses name string, not ID reference
- No team roster or player associations
- Teams cannot be edited after creation (only deleted)

---

## Team Logo Implementation Ideas

### Firebase Free Tier Analysis
**Storage Limits**:
- Storage: 5GB total
- Download: 1GB/day bandwidth

**Logo File Size Estimates**:
- PNG logos (with transparency): ~20-50KB each
- SVG logos: ~5-15KB each (smaller, scalable, recommended)
- High-res PNGs: 100-200KB each

**Storage Math**:
- 100 logos @ 30KB avg = 3MB (tiny!)
- 500 logos @ 30KB avg = 15MB (still tiny!)
- 1000 logos @ 50KB avg = 50MB (very manageable)

**Bandwidth Consideration**:
- Each game loads 2 team logos @ 30KB each = 60KB
- 1GB / 60KB = ~17,000 game loads per day
- **You're nowhere near limits with current usage!**

### Option A: Add Logo Upload to TeamSettingsView
**Approach**: Each team gets an optional logo when created

**Implementation**:
- Add image picker to `TeamSettingsView`
- Store image in Firebase Storage at path: `team-logos/{teamId}.png`
- Store download URL in Team model: `var logoURL: String?`
- Score overlay and game setup load the URL via AsyncImage

**Pros**:
- Centralized team management
- Logo is part of team definition
- Clean data model

**Cons**:
- Have to upload logo immediately when creating team
- Might slow down team creation flow

### Option B: Lazy Logo Upload During Game Setup
**Approach**: Create team without logo initially, add during game setup

**Implementation**:
- Create team without logo in TeamSettingsView
- During game setup, if team has no logo, prompt "Add logo for {teamName}?"
- Upload and associate with team
- Store in same Firebase Storage location

**Pros**:
- More natural workflow
- Don't need logo to create team
- Upload logo when you actually need it

**Cons**:
- Logo upload mixed into game setup flow
- Might be distracting when trying to start game quickly

### Option C: Smart Team Name Matching with Library
**Approach**: Pre-built logo library + custom uploads

**Implementation**:
- Keep library of common team names ("Eagles", "Warriors", "Hornets", etc.)
- Auto-suggest logo from library based on name similarity
- Allow override with custom upload
- Could store library on CDN (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare) to save Firebase bandwidth

**Pros**:
- Best UX - instant logos for common names
- Saves bandwidth (logos served from CDN, not Firebase)
- Still allows custom branding

**Cons**:
- More upfront work to build library
- Need to maintain logo collection
- More complex logic

### Recommended Approach: Option A (Start Simple)

**Steps**:
1. Add `logoURL: String?` to Team model
2. Add image picker to TeamSettingsView (camera or photo library)
3. Upload to Firebase Storage: `team-logos/{teamId}.png`
4. Store URL in team document
5. Load logo in score overlay using AsyncImage with fallback

**Optimizations to Consider**:
- Resize images to max 200×200px before upload (saves bandwidth)
- SVG support if going with pre-built logo library
- Fallback UI: if logo fails to load, show initials in colored circle
- Crop/fit logic for weird aspect ratios

## Overlay Improvements (Fragility Fixes)

### Current Fragility Analysis

**Files to Review**:
- `Views/SimpleScoreOverlay.swift` (main overlay view)
- `Models/SimpleScoreOverlayData.swift` (overlay data model)
- `Views/CleanVideoRecordingView.swift` (recording coordinator)
- `Services/VideoRecordingManager.swift` (camera/recording manager)

**Fragility Points Identified**:

1. **Timer-Based State Updates** (`SimpleScoreOverlay.swift:245-265`)
   - Multiple `Timer.scheduledTimer` instances (progress, zoom, dim)
   - Timers don't always clean up properly on view dismissal
   - **Risk**: Memory leaks, timers firing after view is gone

2. **Orientation Handling** (`SimpleScoreOverlay.swift:25-66`)
   - Manual rotation logic for landscape left/right
   - State changes during orientation transitions
   - **Risk**: Text/elements can jump or misalign

3. **Data Flow Complexity** (`CleanVideoRecordingView.swift:15-54`)
   - Multiple state variables: `overlayData`, `localGameState`, `localClockValue`
   - Timer-based updates from multipeer
   - Independent countdown logic
   - **Risk**: Data can get out of sync, overlay shows wrong info

4. **Real-Time vs Post-Processing Mode** (`VideoRecordingManager.swift:24`)
   - Feature flag: `useRealTimeOverlay` (currently false)
   - Comment: "real-time causes high CPU and connection issues"
   - **Risk**: If accidentally enabled, recordings crash or lag

5. **Fixed Dimensions**
   - Hardcoded sizes: `.frame(width: 50)`, `.padding(.bottom, 40)`
   - Hardcoded fonts: `.font(.system(size: 10, ...))`
   - **Risk**: Breaks on different screen sizes, not ready for logos

### Feature Ideas

#### 16. Overlay Component Isolation
**Problem**: Overlay mixes data management and rendering
**Solution**: Separate concerns

**Proposed Structure**:
```
ScoreboardComponent (pure UI, no timers)
  ← receives data from
ScoreboardDataProvider (manages updates)
  ← listens to
LiveGameStateManager (single source of truth)
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier to test each layer
- Rendering can't break data updates
- Can swap UI without touching data logic

---

#### 17. Use GeometryReader for Adaptive Sizing
**Problem**: Fixed widths/heights break on different devices
**Solution**: Calculate sizes based on screen dimensions

**Benefits**:
- Works on iPad, all iPhone sizes
- Adapts to landscape/portrait
- **Logo-ready**: Space adjusts automatically when logos added
- More professional appearance

**Implementation Note**: Use percentages of screen width instead of hardcoded points

---

#### 18. Combine Instead of Timers
**Problem**: Manual Timer management leads to memory leaks
**Solution**: Use Combine's `Timer.publish()`

**Example**:
```swift
Timer.publish(every: 0.1, on: .main, in: .common)
    .autoconnect()
    .sink { _ in
        // Update here
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatically cancels on view dismissal
- Less memory leak risk
- Cleaner code

---

#### 19. Single Source of Truth for Overlay Data
**Problem**: Multiple state variables (`overlayData`, `localGameState`, `localClockValue`) can get out of sync
**Solution**: Create single `OverlayViewModel`

**Benefits**:
- One place to manage all overlay state
- View just renders, doesn't manage data
- Less chance of data mismatch
- Easier to debug

**Files to Modify**:
- Create new `ViewModels/OverlayViewModel.swift`
- Refactor `CleanVideoRecordingView.swift` to use it

---

#### 20. Orientation Lock
**Problem**: Rotation handling is complex and fragile
**Solution**: Lock recording view to landscape

**Benefits**:
- Camera already locked to `landscapeRight`
- Eliminate all rotation handling code
- Show blocking screen if user rotates away
- Simpler, more stable

**Consideration**: Still need to handle device being landscapeLeft vs landscapeRight

---

#### 21. Overlay Testing/Preview Mode ⭐
**Problem**: Can only test overlay by recording actual video
**Solution**: Create preview mode in Settings

**Implementation**:
- Create `OverlayPreviewView` that shows overlay without camera
- Test with mock data: long team names, different scores, edge cases
- Settings → "Preview Score Overlay"

**Benefits**:
- **Super helpful for testing logo integration!**
- Catch layout issues before recording
- Experiment with styles safely
- No need to record video to test

---

#### 22. Overlay Configuration Model
**Problem**: Styles hardcoded in view code
**Solution**: Create `OverlayTheme` struct

**Example Structure**:
```swift
struct OverlayTheme {
    var backgroundColor: Color
    var textColor: Color
    var accentColor: Color
    var fontSize: CGFloat
    var logoSize: CGSize
    var logoPosition: Position
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to test different looks
- Users could choose themes
- **Logo integration**: theme includes logo size/position
- Separate appearance from logic

---

#### 23. Graceful Degradation ⭐
**Problem**: When things fail, overlay crashes or freezes
**Solution**: Handle failures elegantly

**Examples**:
- Multipeer connection drops → Show "⚠️ Connection Lost"
- Logo fails to load → Show team initials in colored circle
- Clock data missing → Show "--:--"

**Benefits**:
- Overlay should never crash recording
- Better user experience
- Easier to debug issues

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Critical for reliability

---

#### 24. Pre-Recording Validation
**Problem**: Start recording with bad data, discover issues too late
**Solution**: Validate before allowing recording to start

**Checks**:
- ✓ Team names not empty
- ✓ Overlay renders without errors
- ✓ Multipeer connection active (if using controller)
- ✓ Logos loaded (if applicable)

**Benefits**:
- Catch issues early
- Better user experience
- Fewer failed recordings

---

#### 25. Separate Overlay Rendering from Camera
**Problem**: Overlay tightly coupled to camera preview
**Solution**: Render overlay as separate composable layer

**Benefits**:
- Easier to swap overlay designs
- Can test overlay independently
- More modular architecture
- Supports multiple overlay themes

---
